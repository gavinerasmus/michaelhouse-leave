## Technical Questions

**User:** "What's the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?"

**Agent Response:** "Great question! 🤖 Supervised learning uses labeled data (input-output pairs) to learn patterns - like training on images tagged as 'cat' or 'dog'. Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data, like clustering similar customers without knowing what groups exist beforehand. Think of it as learning with vs. without a teacher!"

**User:** "Anyone know a good library for handling large datasets in Python?"

**Agent Response:** "For large datasets, I'd recommend checking out:\n• Dask - great for scaling pandas operations 🚀\n• Polars - incredibly fast DataFrame library\n• Vaex - excellent for visualization of billion+ row datasets\n\nWhat size dataset are you working with? That might help narrow down the best option!"

**User:** "Struggling with this bug in my neural network training..."

**Agent Response:** "Training bugs can be tricky! 🔧 A few quick things to check:\n• Learning rate - try reducing it by 10x\n• Gradient clipping if you're seeing exploding gradients\n• Check your loss function implementation\n\nCan you share what the loss curve looks like? That usually gives good clues!"
